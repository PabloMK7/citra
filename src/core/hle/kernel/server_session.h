/**
 * Kernel object representing the server endpoint of an IPC session. Sessions are the basic CTR-OS
 * primitive for communication between different processes, and are used to implement service calls
 * to the various system services.
 *
 * To make a service call, the client must write the command header and parameters to the buffer
 * located at offset 0x80 of the TLS (Thread-Local Storage) area, then execute a SendSyncRequest
 * SVC call with its ClientSession handle. The kernel will read the command header, using it to
 * marshall the parameters to the process at the server endpoint of the session.
 * After the server replies to the request, the response is marshalled back to the caller's
 * TLS buffer and control is transferred back to it.
