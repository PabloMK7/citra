/**
 * Class containing information about an in-flight IPC request being handled by an HLE service
 * implementation.
 *
 * HLE handle protocol
 * ===================
 *
 * To avoid needing HLE services to keep a separate handle table, or having to directly modify the
 * requester's table, a tweaked protocol is used to receive and send handles in requests. The kernel
 * will decode the incoming handles into object pointers and insert a id in the buffer where the
 * handle would normally be. The service then calls GetIncomingHandle() with that id to get the
 * pointer to the object. Similarly, instead of inserting a handle into the command buffer, the
 * service calls AddOutgoingHandle() and stores the returned id where the handle would normally go.
 *
 * The end result is similar to just giving services their own real handle tables, but since these
 * ids are local to a specific context, it avoids requiring services to manage handles for objects
 * across multiple calls and ensuring that unneeded handles are cleaned up.
 *
 * HLE mapped buffer protocol
 * ==========================
 *
 * HLE services don't have their own virtual memory space, a tweaked protocol is used to simulate
 * memory mapping. The kernel will wrap the incoming buffers into a memory interface on which HLE
 * services can operate, and insert a id in the buffer where the vaddr would normally be. The
 * service then calls GetMappedBuffer with that id to get the memory interface. On response, like
 * real services pushing back the mapped buffer address to unmap it, HLE services push back the
 * id of the memory interface and let kernel convert it back to client vaddr. No real unmapping is
 * needed in this case, though.
